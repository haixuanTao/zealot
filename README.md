# zealot

Reinforcement-learning locomotion on top of [nexus](https://github.com/dimforge/nexus),
dimforge's cross-platform GPU physics engine — aiming to be, roughly, "the
WBC-AGILE of nexus" but all-Rust and WebGPU-native.

## Workspace layout

| Crate | Role | Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zealot-env` | Vectorized environment + MDP layer over nexus's batched `GpuPhysicsPipeline` (observations, actions, rewards, terminations, per-env reset). | Isaac Lab tier |
| `zealot-rl` | Policy network, autodiff, PPO. | rsl_rl tier |

nexus itself provides the GPU physics + parallel environments (the Isaac Sim tier).

## Describing environments

There are three distinct layers, often conflated:

1. **Asset / scene description** (bodies, joints, collision, mass) — URDF / MJCF / USD / SDF.
2. **Engine model** — nexus consumes **rapier** types via `GpuPhysicsState::from_rapier`;
   it has no file-format loader of its own.
3. **RL env contract (the MDP)** — observation / action / reward / reset; this is *code*,
   not a file. In zealot it's the [`EnvConfig`] trait in `zealot-env` (`config.rs`).

Because nexus is rapier-backed, the asset path is always `format → rapier → from_rapier → GPU`,
so the format choice reduces to "what can produce rapier types." Decisions:

- **First toy walker:** build the scene programmatically in Rust (like the nexus examples) —
  faster than authoring/parsing a file for ~5 bodies.
- **Real robots (G1/T1):** load **URDF** via [`rapier3d-urdf`](https://crates.io/crates/rapier3d-urdf)
  (dimforge, rapier 0.32 — matches nexus). MJCF has no mature pure-Rust loader; USD is Omniverse-bound.
- **The MDP** stays Rust code (`EnvConfig`), separate from the asset.

There is no CLI binary — the project is demonstrated through runnable **examples**
in the workspace-root `examples/` directory. They touch the GPU, so each is gated
behind a feature (off by default; needs the [`cargo-gpu`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/cargo-gpu)
toolchain). Two groups:

- **Tensor primitives** (`--features gpu`): vortx forward/backward/Adam demos —
  `linear_forward`, `mlp_forward`, `mlp_backward`, `train_regression`.
  e.g. `cargo run --example train_regression --features gpu`.
- **Pendulum** (`--features pendulum`, in `examples/pendulum/`): a GPU rigid-body
  inverted pendulum and RL trainers on it, from `pendulum_smoke` (a physics smoke
  test) up through `pendulum_pg` (REINFORCE), `pendulum_ppo` (PPO swing-up), and
  `pendulum_gpu_policy` (GPU-resident vortx policy, also needs `gpu`).
  e.g. `cargo run --release --example pendulum_ppo --features pendulum`.
  See [`examples/pendulum/README.md`](examples/pendulum/README.md) for a full
  getting-started guide (prerequisites, the example progression, video rendering).

## Status

The `zealot-env` / `zealot-rl` crates are still scaffolds (env step loop has no
physics yet). The working physics + RL currently lives in the **pendulum
examples**, ported verbatim from nexus-rl's `pendulum_headless`: they drive
`nexus3d` directly rather than going through `zealot-env`/`zealot-rl`. Folding
that logic into the crates is the next step, gated on:

1. A ~10-line nexus patch: make joint-motor targets writable + velocities readable.
2. The learning-stack decision for `zealot-rl`: **burn** (fast, batteries-included)
   vs **vortx + hand-rolled backprop** (unified dimforge/WebGPU stack, stronger
   browser/dora story). Both are confirmed viable on nexus — `pendulum_gpu_policy`
   already trains a vortx policy on-GPU.

## Building

`zealot-env` will depend on `nexus3d`, whose Rust-GPU shaders require
[`cargo-gpu`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/cargo-gpu):

```sh
cargo install cargo-gpu
```

## Development

Versioned git hooks in `.githooks/` enforce formatting, warnings, and tests.
Enable them once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

- **pre-commit** runs `cargo fmt --check` (workspace members only) and
  `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` with `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"`, so any
  warning fails the commit.
- **pre-push** runs `cargo test --workspace` (also with `-D warnings`) so the
  test suite only gates pushes, keeping individual commits fast.

The `gpu` feature is intentionally left off everywhere — its checks need the
`cargo-gpu` toolchain. To run the same checks by hand:

```sh
cargo fmt -p zealot -p zealot-env -p zealot-rl
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --workspace --all-targets
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo test --workspace
```
